INSTRUCTIONS

3. Create a shortcut of "emacsclientw.exe" into a folder that is on PATH (for me that is my %USERPROFILE%\Bin folder).
   Change target to: "C:\Program Files\Emacs\bin\emacsclientw.exe" -na "" "" OR "C:\Program Files\Emacs\bin\emacsclientw.exe" -na "" -c ""
   Set shortcut key to "Ctrl-Alt-E".
4. Create a shortcut of "emacsclientw.exe" into the start menu folder.
